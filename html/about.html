            <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
            <p>I currently live in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where I spend most of my time praying for winter to end. I love Cheezits, Jurassic Park (book and movie), dogs, swimming and nature documentaries. My favorite hobbies include designing websites and graphics for companies that don’t exist and planning the decor for the home that I don’t yet own. I am a very hard worker and am constantly working towards learning new skills. </p>

            <h2>My career journey:</h2>
            <p>I began my professional career in video production, and my work with motion graphics introduced me to the world of design. This world fascinated me, and I wanted to learn everything there was to know. After taking some courses and doing endless amounts of research, it occured to me that I could take this passion and use it create beautiful, functional websites. This discovery lead me to design and code my very first website. This was the most satisfying experience I had ever taken part in and, after years of searching, I knew I had figured out what to do with the rest of my life.</p>
            <p>I finally was able to make this dream come true when I enrolled in Prime Digital Academy and am working towareds a certification in full-stack software engineering.</p>
